# Project Governance

The basic principle is that decisions are based on consensus.
If this decision making process takes too long or a decision is required, the Technical Steering Committee has the authority to make a decision.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for:

1. General ambitions, objectives and goals of this project
1. Guidelines, procedures and tool selection
1. Architectural and (development) infrastructure choices
1. Raising subjects/issues that are important for the direction/development of this project

The Technical Steering Committee consists of the following members:
1. [Nico Rikken](https://github.com/nicorikken), Open Source Ambassador, Alliander
1. [Jonas van den Bogaard](https://github.com/Jonasvdbo), Open Source Program Office Lead, Alliander

The Open Source Ambassador will chair the TSC.

We will develop a process for appointments to the TSC with the community when the project has grown enough to need this.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for maintaining parts of the codebase. Maintainers have the following responsibilities:

1. Coordinate development activity
1. Make sure code/documentation reviews are being done
1. Coordinate pull-requests
1. Coordinate bug follow-ups
1. Coordinate questions

In case of long discussions or arguments, maintainers or others can request a Technical Steering Committee decision.

The current maintainers of this project are:
 1. Nico Rikken - Open Source Ambassador, Alliander

We will develop a process for appointing additional maintainers with the community when the project has grown enough to need this.

## Contributors

[See the list of OSPO Code Scanner contributors](https://github.com/Alliander/ospo-code-scanner/graphs/contributors). 

Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the project.

Anyone can become a contributor.
There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process.
To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.
